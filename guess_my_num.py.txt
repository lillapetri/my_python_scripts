#Exercise: guess my number

# In this problem, you'll create a program that guesses a secret number!
# The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). The computer makes
# guesses, and you give it input - is its guess too high or too low? Using bisection search, the computer will guess the user's secret
# number!

number = int(input("Please think of a number between 0 and 100. "))
lowest = 0
highest = 100
game = True

while game == True:
    guess = (lowest + highest) // 2
    print("Is your secret number " + str(guess) + "?", end=" ")
    x = input(
        "Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly.")
    if x != "l" and x != "h" and x!= "c":
        print("Sorry, I did not understand your input. Try again.")
    elif x == "c":
        game = False
        print("Game over. Your secret number was " + str(guess) + ".")
    elif x == "h":
        highest = guess
    elif x == "l":
        lowest = guess
